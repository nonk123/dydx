* dydx

A derivative calculator for Lisp forms, made in Scheme.

Usage example:

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
  (derive 'x '(expt x 2))
#+END_SRC

This will calculate the derivative of xÂ² in respect to x. The result
of the call is a Lisp form you can evaluate with =primitive-eval=
(assuming you set =x= to something meaningful beforehand).

The call should return something like:

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
  '(* 1 (* 2 x))
#+END_SRC

For a list of supported functions (mostly trigonometric), look up the
value of =common-derivatives=. It is an alist-mapping of common
functions to their derivatives in respect to x.

Things like chain rule, derivative of a sum, etc. are all built into
the derivation engine.
